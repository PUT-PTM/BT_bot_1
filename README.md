## Overwiev
Can't you have a dog? Do you have allergies to fur? Parents don't want a small furry family member?
Calm down! You can create your own dachshund and... it will not mess up! :)

## Description
Project include a program in C language for microcontroller STM32F407VG DISCOVERY and an Android application in Java.
Whole dachshund is powered by a Power Bank. It's controlled by application and it can move forward, backward, left and right.

## IDE
- CoIDE 1.7.8
- Android Studio 2.3.3

## Tools
- Microcontroller STM32F407VG DISCOVERY
- Bluetooth module HC-06 FC-114
- HG7881 module (L9110) for engines
- Chassis 2WD Robot Car
- Power Bank 
- Smartphone with Android system
